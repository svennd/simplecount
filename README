Extension Name: SimpleCount
Author: SvennD

Extension Description: This replaces the default exact value of posts/users/topics of the forum with an easy referenced number (such as 4K instead of 4032); The idea is based on the counting system in Wolfram Alpha. I used the code from TimeAgo extension by MuhClaren to get this extension working, thanks MuhClaren!
